# Simple Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder

This is a simple Python script to encode or decode text using a Caesar Cipher. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. Follow the prompts:
    - Enter whether you want to encode or decode the text.
    - Enter the text you want to encode or decode.
    - Enter the shift number (how many positions each letter should be shifted).

## Example

```bash
What do you want to do to your text: encode or decode? encode
Enter your text: hello
Enter shift number: 3
Encrypted text is khoor
